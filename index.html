  <h1 class="_center">The Future of Bitcoin</h1>
  <p>As Bitcoin faces its first evolutionary growing pains and active debate about the future of the network continues, the need for open dialog is becoming more important than ever. The purpose of OnChain Scaling events is to bring focus to solutions and ideas that will help scale the on-chain network capacity and ecosystem. Although many interesting approaches to scaling involve off-chain or second layer networks, on-chain innovations are important as they have a direct effect on growing network adoption in the near-term without introducing new economic variables.</p>

  <p>The secondary goal of these conferences is to address and explore the widespread global effect of the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency phenomenon, its potential to change and revolutionize the way people think about economics and money, and how it can be used to empower the underserved.  Topics can range from mining economics, online privacy, network security and resiliency, user interface, consensus algorithms and financial distruption.</p>

  <p>Please consider this an invitation to join us and our esteemed presenters, which include academics from diverse backgrounds of economics, physicists, cryptographers, and computer scientists for this online event, including Jeff Garzik as the featured speaker.</p>
