  <h1 class="_center">The Future of Bitcoin</h1>
  <p>As Bitcoin faces its first growing pains and active debate about the future of the network continues, the need for open dialog is becoming more important than ever.  The purpose of this conference is to bring focus to specific scaling solutions that will help scale Bitcoin on-chain. Although many interesting approaches to scaling involve off-chain or second layer networks, On-chain innovations are also important as they have a direct effect on growing the Bitcoin network’s adoption in the near-term without introducing new economic variables.</p>

  <p>Thus, the primary theme of this Scaling Bitcoin On-Chain conference is designed to discuss solutions to scale Bitcoin’s on-chain capacity, resiliency, and security.</p>

  <p>This may lead to new solutions, changes to the protocol, or additions to the protocol to support new features. (fraud proofs, zkp).  No topic is taboo, and discussion of all topics will be encouraged, even those which may require hard forks.</p>

  <p>The secondary conference themes include Hard forks vs Soft forks and its social and moral effects, and if they are safe? Fair? Are they a natural evolution mechanism that Satoshi intended?</p>

  <h1 class="_center">Join In</h1>
  <p>Please consider this an invitation to any academics with proposals regarding scaling the Bitcoin network.  If you have a proposal, we would like to have you make a 20-30 min talk about it.  We would prefer proposals which have some experimental supporting data to back up the proposal. </p>

  <p>If you are interested in making a presentation, please contact <a href="mailto:contact@onchainscaling.com">contact@onchainscaling.com</a>, and please include a copy or link to an abstract of your research paper or your presentation topic.  The conference is tentatively scheduled to be 27th-28th of May.  If you have scheduling concerns or special considerations, please let us know.</p>

  <p>If you would like to sponsor the event, please contact <a href="mailto:sponsor@onchainscaling.com">sponsor@onchainscaling.com</a></p>
