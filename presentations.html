    <h2>Expedited Forwarding in Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>
    <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#stone">Andrew Stone</a></span>
    <p class="more">
      To optimise the propagation of transactions and blocks, it makes sense to minimize the per-hop latency -- that is, minimize the time it takes to move data from one node to another.  Currently, the bitcoin network uses a three message sequential conversation to send a block or transaction.  This talk will report on efforts and discuss strategies to reduce this to a single message, and will also provide a general Bitcoin Unlimited status update.

        <h2>Braiding the Blockchain</h2>
        <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#mcelrath">Bob McElrath</a></span>
        <p class="more">
            The "chain" structure of Bitcoin only works if the network is
            synchronous and new blocks are propagated with zero latency. Since the real
            network is asynchronous, orphans (stale blocks) appear due to this
            communications latency.  By allowing blocks to name multiple parents, we can tie
            up asynchronously produced blocks into a specialization of a Directed Acyclic
            Graph we call a "braid".  The orphan problem causes a race condition among
            miners that reduces the security of the system [Eyal et. al.].  We present an
            analysis of this braid structure on a Bitcoin-like network and present (1) how
            to achieve the fastest possible block time in such an asynchronous network (2)
            an analysis of the Bitcoin network under this additional assumption -- which
            indicates an optimal equivalent block time of 11.6s.  Moving to a braid can
            drastically increase the transaction rate accepted by the network while reducing
            the block time, provide a mechanism to heal network splits, and dynamically
            adjust to changing network conditions.

        <h2>Block space as a commodity</h2>
        <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#rizun">Dr. Peter Rizun</a></span>
        <p class="more">
            This talk will explore the question of whether block size is a useful tool for enforcing policy or an emergent phenomenon of the network. From the policy-tool perspective, the block size represents a “lever” that policy makers might use to balance the cost of operating a node with the market price for block space (i.e., transaction fees). Assuming only that block space obeys the laws of supply and demand, we will show that for any given market condition, there exists an artificial block size limit that will produce greater network security and slower blockchain growth than the equivalent no-limit case, at the expense of higher transaction fees and reduced economic activity. Despite the flexibility offered by the policy-tool approach, we will show that little empirical evidence exists that the network is capable of enforcing a strict block size limit, questioning whether the policy-tool perspective is valid. We conclude by suggesting a simple change to the Bitcoin software to empower each node operator to more easily express his free choice regarding the size of blocks he is willing to accept while simultaneously ensuring that his node tracks consensus.

        <h2>MINING PANEL: Q&A</h2>
        <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#"></a></span>
        <p class="more">
        Open panel discussion with some of the current prominant Bitcoin miners and industries.  Part of a healthy ecosystem is open dialog between all the industry participants and stakeholders.  This is an opportunity to have a dialog in a town hall format, so that we can foster healthy communication and understanding between all parties.

    <h2>Pushing the envelope - How Scaling Leads to Scaling</h2>
    <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#garzik">Jeff Garzik</a></span>
    <p class="more">
      A risk posture based on current technical capabilities will overly constrain any system's growth. Bitcoin and the world at large are complex dynamic systems that respond to feedback. A useful system growing will be met with virtuous, self-reinforcing cycles of improvement as capacity challenges appear.

    <h2>Hard Forks and Schism forks why can't we have both?</h2>
    <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#rosenfield">Meni Rosenfield</a></span>
    <p class="more">
      A lot of commotion and misconceptions has been drawn up about the scary nature of hard forks and how it could potentially result in Bitcoin splitting into 2 separate, non-fungible currencies.  But what if that could be made safe?  Would it then be such a bad thing?

        <p class="more">
            The bandwidth and time required to propagate new blocks on the Bitcoin network presents a scaling challenge. Xtreme Thinblocks uses a unique Bloom filter to take advantage of the shared knowledge of pending transactions, reducing the resources needed to send new blocks between nodes.

        <p class="more">
          My presentation focuses on Bitcoin use cases in small-scale, cross-border trade. I am Executive Director of Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation, which promotes the use of Bitcoin among the world's unbanked and underbanked. Currently, we work primarily with entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in West Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. For the 5.5 billion potential Bitcoin users, its use as a P2P medium of exchange is of greatest value.

        <span class="author"><a href="/speakers.html#andrea">Andrea Suisani</a></span>
        <p class="more">
            The main objective was to obtain useful BU node performance statistics for real-time block propagation within and outside the Great Firewall of China (GFC) along with a more in deep knowledge of performance gain brought by Xthin technology when used on the broad bitcoin p2p network.


            During the talk I’ll cover all the needed steps we had to made to achieve our goal and what we have learnt about the interaction between the bitcoin p2p network and the GFC.
