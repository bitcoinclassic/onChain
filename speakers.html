    <h2>Jeff Garzik</h2>
    <p>Jeff Garzik is a futurist, entrepreneur and software engineer. Jeff is co-founder and CEO of Bloq. Jeff serves on the board of Coin Center, and the advisory board of BitFury, BitPay, Chain.com, Netki and WayPaver Labs. Jeff has delivered presentations on bitcoin and blockchain at TEDx, State of Digital Money, many bitcoin conferences, as well as private briefings to corporations, governments, central banks, and hedge funds.

Jeff has a long history of early technology adoption. After helping to inaugurate CNN.com on the Internet in the early 1990s, he worked for a succession of Internet startups and service providers. At the same time, he worked continuously on open source software engineering projects for over two decades.

Involvement in one of the best known open source projects - the Linux kernel - led to an extended tenure at Linux leader Red Hat during open source's most formative years. Jeff's work is found in every Android phone and data center Linux installation today.

In July 2010, Jeff stumbled across a post describing bitcoin. Immediately recognizing the potential of a concept previously thought impossible -- decentralized digital money, he did what came naturally: developed bitcoin open source software. That gave rise to the start of micro-businesses with bitcoin at their foundation. Almost by accident, Jeff found himself at the heart of the global, revolutionary, technology phenomenon known as bitcoin.

Bitcoin and blockchain served as a springboard for many new ideas and ventures, including sending objects into outer space.</p>

    <h2>Dr. Bob McElrath</h2>
    <p>Bob's first career was as a theoretical physicist, and he wrote 30+ papers
on on Higgs bosons, dark matter, and black holes at particle colliders like the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN.  That wasn't nearly interesting enough for him so
he took a left turn into remaking money with cryptography, and is now CTO and
Chief Scientist for SolidX Partners in New York.  He's now working on building
an identity platform on blockchains and tutoring bankers about Bitcoin. <br>Bob is an editor for the Ledger Journal.</p>
